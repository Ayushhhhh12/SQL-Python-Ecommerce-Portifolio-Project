<p>This project demonstrates my ability to manage, clean, analyze, and visualize large datasets using SQL and Python. The focus is on leveraging SQL for data manipulation and Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.</p>

<h2>Key Features:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Processed a large, raw dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and normalizing data using Pandas and NumPy. Ensured the dataset was ready for analysis by following best practices in data cleaning.</li>
    <li><strong>SQL Integration:</strong> Wrote efficient SQL queries to extract, filter, and aggregate data. Utilized SQL joins, subqueries, and window functions to manipulate the dataset and uncover meaningful insights.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, patterns, and correlations within the dataset. Used statistical techniques to draw insights and validate assumptions.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> Created a range of visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to communicate the results effectively. Plotted histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps to showcase key findings.</li>
    <li><strong>Project Documentation:</strong> The repository includes detailed documentation, including SQL queries, Python scripts, and visualization outputs. Each step of the process is documented to provide a clear understanding of the workflow.</li>
</ul>
